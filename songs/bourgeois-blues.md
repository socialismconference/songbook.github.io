## Bourgeois Blues

> by Leadbelly

Lord, in a bourgeois town  
It's a bourgeois town  
I got the bourgeois blues  
Gonna spread the news all around

Home of the brave, land of the free  
I don't wanna be mistreated by no bourgeoisie  
Lord, in a bourgeois town  
Uhm, the bourgeois town  
I got the bourgeois blues  
Gonna spread the news all around

Well, me and my wife we were standing upstairs  
We heard the white man say "I don't want no niggers up there"  
Lord, in a bourgeois town  
Uhm, bourgeois town  
I got the bourgeois blues  
Gonna spread the news all around

Well, them white folks in Washington they know how  
To call a colored man a nigger just to see him bow  
Lord, it's a bourgeois town  
Uhm, the bourgeois town  
I got the bourgeois blues  
Gonna spread the news all around

I tell all the colored folks to listen to me  
Don't try to find you no home in Washington, DC  
'Cause it's a bourgeois town  
Uhm, the bourgeois town  
I got the bourgeois blues  
Gonna spread the news all around
