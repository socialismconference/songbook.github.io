## Roll the Union On

> Music and Lyrics by John L. Handcox

We’re gonna roll, we’re gonna roll, we’re gonna roll the union on  
We’re gonna roll, we’re gonna roll, we’re gonna roll the union on  
And, if the planter's in the way  
We’re gonna roll it over him  
We’re gonna roll it over him  
We’re gonna roll it over him  
And, if the planter's in the way  
We’re gonna roll right over him  
We’re gonna roll the union on

Use the same pattern with:

And, if the boss is in the way...  
And, if the bank is in the way...

> A variety of improvisations can be applied to the pattern: 

And, if the scabs is in the way...  
And, if gun thugs get in the way...  
And, if the cops get in the way...  
And, if Rahm is in the way...  
And, if Trump is in the way...  
et alia
